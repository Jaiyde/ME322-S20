We begin to introduce the idea of lifting this incompressible assumption.
It turns out that this reaches as far down to the navier stokes equations themselves. 
If the equations weren't hard enough to solve now they are even harder. 
Remember that MATERIAL derivative. 
Well in incompressible flow the density is now a field as well. 
Every point in space can have a different density value. 
This means the MATERIAL derivative of the density function is not constant but coupled with the Velocity Field and Pressure Field.
Compressibility adds another equation to the governing system. 
This equation is called an "Equation of State" and is heavily linked to Thermodynamics.
So you will see that compressible flow, at its simplest applied form, is really Thermodynamics + Bernoulli.
This is because an equation of state relates (pressure, temperature, and density).
In gases we are VERY familiar with one of these already.
The ideal gas law works wonderfully for air. 
You should appreciate how as complex compressible flow is, 
We can just combine the major points of the ideal gas law and the energy equation of streamlines to do some fluids.
It is important to focus on the assumptions we need to do this and to appreciate how the Navier Stokes have changed from lifting one assumption.
