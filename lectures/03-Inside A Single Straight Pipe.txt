This lecture is the derivation of the steady, fully developed, laminar flow in a straight pipe. 
The mathematical solution, the expression, we get is so fundamental...like I can't even. 
It has gone on to inspire almost everything about pipe flow, non-circular duct flows, or all internal flow.
The solution allows us to calculate shear stresses (for laminar or turbulent flows).
We get an expression for flowrate in the pipe. 
We can calculate the average velocity of fluid in the pipe. 
We then take our solution and formulate a Darcy Friction factor "f". 
This term helps us detetmine the viscous losses (how much energy is needed to overcome) long straight sections of pipe.

Then we go into the problem of turbulence in pipes. (most pipe applications are turbulent) 
There is a remarkable similarity to the techniques used in the round spherical cow solution (laminar).
Essentially everything comes down to "what is the velocity profile u(r)."
You will see that everything is a consequence of getting this u(r) expression. 
Turbulence uses reasonable assumptions and scaling arguements to estimate this u(r).
We then cut to the chase and cite some amazing formulas for the same friction factor "f" if the flow is turbulent.
99% of the time your problems will be turbulent so these nasty formulae are things we should get good at. 
You have to solve one of them with an iterative algorithm.

Roughness is also addressed in these equation.

HW FOCUS: Using a moody chart (I'd much rather you write a program though that does this automatically)
Tables are like extremely out of date and I think we need to advance as mechanical engineers. 
Using the colebrook equation. 

EXAM FOCUS: Each term of the laminar solution. Explaining where the Moody chart comes from.
Understanding the difference of laminar and turbulent methods. Posing dimensional functional form assumptions.
