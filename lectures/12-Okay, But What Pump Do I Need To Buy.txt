This lecture goes over the basic curves we plot in order to select curves. 
The first requirement is the NPSH. 
We never want cavitation in pumps. 
It damages the material. 
This plot essentially puts a lower bound on our graph that we want all other curves to be above. 
The next is the pump curve.
This can be approxiamted as a line (analytical equation) or experimented to get a more realistic curve.
The other curve is the system curve, you spend your whole project doing the book keeping that goes into estimating this curve.
The last curve is the efficiency curve. 
This curve is important because we always want the power we are paying for to go into the fluid.
This marks a BEP point along the x-axis. 
The operating point also marks a Q on the x-axis. 
WE WANT THESE TO BE AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE. 
The combination of all these curves gives us a systematic way to select approximately the best pump.
At a high level there are so many variables but in design just stick to the concept. 
I want to drive the operating flowrate as close as I possibly can to the BEP.
There are infinite many ways to do this all governed by problem constraints.
As engineers we fiddle and tinker to get things kinda sorta right.
