We shift the focus now to now the selection of this pump drawing in our piping networks. 
We have always simply assumed the pump gave us an added energy. 
Well were does that number come from?
How can we estimate the preformance of the pump before buying it.

Before we solved problems to try and find appropriate dimensions.
This isn't always the case though. 
Sometime we can't change the piping system dimensions. 
We are restricted to simply upgrading the pump, the energy giver.

So here we investigate the physical nature of different pumps.
