We now develop tools to consider fluid moving around a body. 
All the calculations we developed earlier were for internal flows (pipes).
It is clear that there is something fundamentally different about external flow just from looking at it.
The first qualitative difference is that if we put dye, or streamline visualizers in the flow, 
we notice that "far away from the body" all the streamlines look parallel. 
We also notice that "close to the body" the streamlines deviate around the body. 
This deviation can sometimes be quite beautiful in images.

We already know that a body in a flow field a force.
Just like when you put your hand out the window you feel the pressure, the force.
This is called drag.
You are feeling the force needed to push the air molecules out of you're way. 
This concept of viscous fluid that we've developed illuminates a completely different force though.
It is the skin friction of the body. 
You are feeling the force of the air molecule dragging across your skin as they flow past you're skin. 

This entire section of the course in external flow is all about calculating these numbers. 
We develop it from the ground up however. 
Just like internal flow, we start with the little bits of fluids and work our way up to the bulk effects. 

HW FOCUS: calculate boundary layer thickness, calculate drag and skin friction, drag coefficient

EXAM FOCUS: describe scale analysis, draw the boundary layer, 
draw the momentum and displacement thickness and describe their meaning, the 4 steps of boundary layer analysis.
