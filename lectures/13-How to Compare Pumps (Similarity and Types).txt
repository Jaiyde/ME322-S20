This lecture goes over the similaity laws used to compare pumps.
It is a an excercise in the dimensional analysis,
and to see how from square one an engineer can derive far reaching relationships.
The most surprising non-dimensional term is the specific speed. 
This value can tell you the type of pump at optimum performance to use based on requirements. 
It is amazing that this order of magnitude scale arguments work at all really. 
The take away is that they are ALL rooted in physical arguments. 
The ability to abstract your problem to an unknown function you will never know 
and dimensional inputs/output which you know you can measure allows for amazing analysis. 
Selecting pumps concludes here, as now you know the GOAL of pump selection.
You also know methods to acheive that goal such as changing K, multiple pumps, etc.
