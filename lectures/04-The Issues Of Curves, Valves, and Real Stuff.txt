All the work before was to get this friction term. 
We were trying to calculate the losses in pipe due to simply flowing thru the pipe itself. 
We utilized the energy equation to do this. 
This is because losses is a fancy word for an energy requirement.
We take the exact same methodology and apply it to elbows, curves, and piping components.
We can do some math magic as well and come up with a way to redraw our pipin systems as one straight pipe. 
This is similar to effective resistor networks, we jsut called them effective lengths. 

These expression require experimental coefficients, so we've left the totally theoretical. 
When ever you buy a piping component ou can actually find these values.
The manufacturer tested them rigourously to give you this number confidently.

The losses attributed to these components are called minor losses.
That is because you will see most of the energy needed it to simply flow through the darn pipe.
The last part of straight tube is if it is non-circular (like a rectangle). 
It almost seems like a trivial fix we do,
but I promise it is based on a rigourous infinite series soluiton.


HW FOCUS: calcualting minor losses. Calculating effective lengths. Hydraulic diameter.
