That was all just one straight pipe we did. 
The next process is what every real building has. 
Lots of pipes running in parallel and series. 
In reality everything we have done up until this point is only useful for 10% of engineering problems.
But the expressions and methods extend to an entire network of pipes.
We then formulate the Hardy-Cross method.
This is a recipe for a computer to spit out all the quanitities we've been calculating all this time.
It can do it for more massive systems, systems that make the human brain seem feeble and weak.
We will see how they end up looking alot like circuits, in certain cases.

NOTE: I've actually extended this section from previous lecture notes because everyone wanted 
real world example and well...this is the real world type problem. 

HW FOCUS: Parallel and Series pipe systems (flowrate, dimensions, etc).  

EXAM FOCUS: Describe the Hardy-Cross method. Know when it is NOT exactly like electrical circuits.
