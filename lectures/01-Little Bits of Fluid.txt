First thing is first. We need to describe the velocity of fluid in mathematical terms. 
How do we do that?
Well we have to imagine ourselve where they were in the 1800s. 
All we know is F=ma.
That equation was only good for idealized point particles.
For a rigid body it applies to the center of mass of the body. 
But a fluid is different, it is NOT rigid. 
We need to extend this equation to a continuous jelly region of fluid. 

So lets draw a lit bit of fluid and ask how fast it is moving. 
We first need a coordinate system then. 
We need some framework to beable to put a number to where something is.
