This a pure motivational lecture that trys to set the stage for things we need to answer.
There is clearly a difference between laminar and turbulent flows,
but how does that effect quantities we care about. 
We also get our first look at defending a certain assumption commonly made in fluid analysis. 
This issue of 'fully developed'. 
We get an expression that allow us engineers to calculate when our problems satisfy this assumption. 


HW FOCUS: Calculate Reynolds numbers, Calculating entrance lengths, 
describe laminar vs turbulent in more quantitative and qualitative terms. 

EXAM FOCUS: Beable to plot entrance effects.
