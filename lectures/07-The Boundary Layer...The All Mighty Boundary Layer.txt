We begin our bottom up approach by zooming close into a surface that is sittin in a flow field.
This is called the boundary layer.
The scales involved allow us to simplify the navier stokes equations. 
This new set of impossible partial differential equations are called the Boundary Layer Equations. 
You can get a PhD simply studying these bad kahunas alone. 

Two quantities that you use alot are the "displacement" and "momentum" thickness. 
We will see how these are defined. 
How to use them. 
How to interpret them. 
Skin friction is also related to this boundary layer and we will see the explicit dependence to the Reynolds.
This answer the question how much force does it take to slide past a body. 
This question perplexed alot of fluids people back in the early days of flight. 
There is no way to account for this skin friction without the analysis we've done.
