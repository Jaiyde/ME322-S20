Lets add a little bit of irreversibility into the process. 
The simplest way will be to look at a single straight duct with rough walls. 
This addition of losses means that the velocity will change.
You should understand at this point that fluids people do everything non-dimensional. 
We have too many parameters to track. 
The mach number is simply the nondimensional velcoity when a problem is close to the speed of sound.
Fanno flow looks at how velocity changes along the striaght duct.
That is how does dM/dx behave, where x is the axial direction down the duct.
This is Fanno's differential equation/
Since we're dealing with losses wouldn't you believe it but a friction factor arises in it as well!
At the end we get a plot that looks like spaghetti thrown on graph paper.
Fear not!
We will look at each curve and study how to reason it. 
We can also connect Fanno Flow analysis with Isentropic Flow in nozzles.
For changing area sections use Isentropic and for constant area sections use Fanno.
