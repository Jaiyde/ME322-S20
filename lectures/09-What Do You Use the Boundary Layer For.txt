We use this entire lecture to summarize the expressions we've developed. 
From the first principles of a boundary layer we can calculate lots of forces. 
These forces help planes fly. 
This boundary layer or realted quantities can be found in alot of equations. 
The methods to derive the boundary layer also help us rationalize curved surfaces. 
If you put a sphere in a flow field you can see a "seperation" occur. 
This is why there are dimples on a golf ball. 
This effect of seperation can be calculated and we see a different kind of pressure gradient. 
Curved surface require us to consider streamlines and again energy. 
We see how reynolds numbers are a main independent quanitity in most problems.
