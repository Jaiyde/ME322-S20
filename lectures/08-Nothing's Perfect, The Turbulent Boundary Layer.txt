The turbulent boundary layer is a different beast.
Most flows in practice are turbulent though. 
Very similar to internal flow though most expressions look remarkably similar accept correction terms.
At this point it should be burned into your brain that if we can write down a velocity distribution u(y),
we can calculate a whole ton of stuff. 

Turbulence is difficult, but alot of the hard work is in estimating this u(y).  
We can just start from there and get all the expressions. 
However it is very important we know when and when not to use these expressions.
The assumptions must be memorized to great detail. 

Just as in laminar flow the point is to beable to calculate a drag coefficient. 
The drag coefficient in turbulent flows are more complicated but the general idea is the same.
