By now the dust has been uncovered from the thermodynamics bin in your head. 
Just as we studied a single straight pipe, a flat thin plate, and an ideal centrifugal pump with no swirl
We will study isentropic flow. 
This is flow with a consant value of Entropy. 
This means that the process is reversible and is a best case scenerio all real world cases will be worse than. 
Recall how helpful the ideal pump law was though!
These assumptions allow us analyze flow through a duct with changing area and no heat flux.
The process culminates in expressing density, pressure, and temperature in terms of the Mach number. 
The actual algebra here get hard with nonlinear powers, and we have to redo it for different sections of the nozzle.
There are only three sections to analyze though. Convering, Min Throat, and Diverging seciton.
